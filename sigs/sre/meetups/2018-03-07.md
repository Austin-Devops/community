# March 07, 2018

## Abstract
This meetup will be the official kick-off of the [Austin Devops](https://www.meetup.com/austin-devops) SRE SIG, and also the first ever official [Austin Devops SIG](https://github.com/Austin-Devops/community/tree/master/sigs) meetup!

Rather than host a traditional presentation format, we'll be running a group styled [lean coffee](http://leancoffee.org/) session. Attendees and organizers will work together to decide as a group what type of events and content we'd like to see in future meetups.

Drinks (including an on-site bartender :scream:) and food will be provided by one of our awesome sponsors, [RetailMeNot](https://www.retailmenot.com).

### Remote Sharing
For those who are unable to physically be present at this meeting, we're going to be piloting a new remote-sharing process! We're going to livestream the Large Group Lean Coffee segment (_7 - 7:30 PM CST_), via twitch, at this location: [https://www.twitch.tv/luccacabra](https://www.twitch.tv/luccacabra). 

**NOTE** This is in an alpha-alpha-alpha (read: we have no idea what we're doing yet :ok_hand:) phase. We're still figuring out what technologies and resources we have available to make this experience awesome, so please, bear with us while we formalize this process. :sweat:
