# SIGs
SIGs are [special interest groups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Interest_Group#Technical_SIGs) for sub-topics within DevOps. They have their own meetup schedule and content separate from the larger DevOps organization.

## Creating a new SIG

## Sign-Off
All new SIGs require sign-off from at least one [SIG admin](../sigs/OWNERS). While this is a bit of extra red tape, it helps to help us moderate content and prevent duplicate or non-devops related SIGs. :blush:

In order to get sign-off for the creation of a new SIG, please file a [New SIG Proposal](https://github.com/austin-devops/community/issues/new?labels=sig-proposal&title=New+SIG+Proposal&template=sig_proposal_template.md) issue.

This issue will automatically notify the SIG admins of your request, and they should be in touch shortly with a decision.

## Post Sign-Off
Once you've gotten sign-off from an admin, you'll need to create [New SIG](https://github.com/austin-devops/community/issues/new?labels=sig-new&title=New+SIG&template=new_sig_template.md) issue.

This issue will contain all the necessary instructions for finishing the new SIG process!
