## Agreement

The Austin DevOps community provides books for checkout free of charge to all community members. We encourage community members to take advantage of this resource and treat the books respectfully. The books do not necessarily represent the community's point of view; if you think any book that was added to the library should be removed, please contact us with your rationale. We will follow up with you and take appropriate steps.

By signing this agreement, you agree to the following rules:

- Do not write in, highlight, or otherwise deface the books. Remember, someone else wants to read them without your notes.
- Return any book you borrow within the timeframe that you pledge to return it in your checkout request. The default period if you did not specify a time period in your checkout request is **2 weeks**.
- If you damage or lose a book, you will be responsible for replacing the book. If there are extenuating circumstances, such as your car got broken into and the book was stolen, please reach out to us for help.
- If you refuse to return a book and refuse to replace it, you understand that we will take appropriate steps, which may include banning you from the lending library program or otherwise reducing your access to the community as a whole.

By signing this agreement, you certify that you've read all of this document and agree to the entirety of the document at the time of your signature. We will verify any discrepancies based on git history.
